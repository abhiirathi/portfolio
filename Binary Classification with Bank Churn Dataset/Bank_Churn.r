# Problem Statement
# Identifying and Mitigating Factors Contributing to Elevated Customer Churn Rates

# The analysis has revealed a critical challenge facing our bank: a higher churn rate 
# in certain segments, particularly pronounced among customers with positive balances
# (approx 20% churn rate) as opposed to those with zero balance (only 6% churn rate). 
# This disparity indicates potential shortcomings in the bankâ€™s service offerings and suggests 
# that customers with positive balances may perceive a lack of value or inadequate service relative
# to the financial assets they hold with the bank, prompting them to seek alternative banks that
# offer better benefits for their needs.
# Additionally, the geographical variation in churn, with a notable increase in Germany (32%) 
# compared to just approx 6% in France and Spain, suggests the need for a region-specific 
# approach to customer retention. The imperative now is for the bank to conduct 
# a thorough review of its customer service strategy, address the drivers of customer turnover, 
# and implement targeted interventions. The strategic focus must be on enhancing the customer 
# experience and loyalty to safeguard the bank's market position and ensure long-term profitability.

# identified by the model. A sensitivity of 0.85 means that the model correctly 
# identified 85% of the customers who will exit. This indicates a strong ability of 
# the model to capture the customers at risk of churn.

specificityVal <- round(specificity(final.test$Exited, fitted.results),2)

# Specificity(0.7): The true negative rate, reflects the model's ability to correctly
# identify negative cases (customers who will not exit). For example, a specificity of
# 0.70 would mean that 70% of the customers who will not exit are correctly identified
# by the model. Higher specificity indicates that the model is effective in identifying 
# customers who are likely to stay.

# Conclusion - Logistic Regression
# The confusion matrix for the logistic regression model reveals an interesting balance
# between recognizing stable customers and predicting potential departures. With a respectable
# accuracy of 83%, the model reliably forecasts the majority of customer behaviors. However, a
# sensitivity of 85% indicates it's better at detecting customers who might leave the bank (true positives)
# but not perfect, as it overlooks some (false negatives). Specificity at 70% suggests the model is less adept
# at affirming customers who will stay (true negatives), occasionally mistaking a loyal customer
# for a departing one (false positives).
# Therefore, while the logistic regression model is good at flagging potential churn,
# there's room for improvement to ensure that loyal customers are correctly identified and retained.

# The graph depicts a significant variance in churn predictions across the three countries. 
# Notably, Germany exhibits a churn prediction rate of 32.1%, which is substantially 
# higher than that of France and Spain, sitting at 6.2% and 6.8% respectively. This stark contrast 
# suggests that customers in Germany are more than five times as likely to churn compared 
# to the other two regions. Such a discrepancy points to the possibility of underlying 
# issues unique to Germany, be it economic factors, customer satisfaction levels, or 
# competitive market dynamics. It underscores the need for the bank to closely examine its 
# market strategy and customer engagement approaches in Germany, potentially conducting 
# detailed customer feedback surveys or market analysis to identify and address the root
# causes of the elevated churn rate.

#[2] Age Wise Bank Churn - Density Plot

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #center aligning the plot title

# The density plot reveals two distinct trends: the red area, signifying the
# churn, peaks notably for customers aged 35-50, suggesting this demographic
# is more predisposed to leaving the bank. This could be attributed to critical financial
# decision-making periods in their lives, where they might be exploring more competitive
# banking options that offer better rates or services for mortgages, savings plans for
# education of children, or retirement planning.
# Conversely, the blue curve, indicating customers predicted not to churn, is more
# dominant in the younger (below 35) and older (above 50) age brackets. Younger customers
# may be in the early stages of their financial journey and thus less likely to churn
# due to fewer financial commitments or a lower propensity to switch banks. Older customers
# might exhibit loyalty or a preference for stability, making them less inclined to change
# their banking relationships.

#[3] Credit Score Wise Bank Churn - Boxplot
ggplot(df.new_customers, aes(x = factor(Predicted_Churn), y = CreditScore, fill = factor(Predicted_Churn))) +

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #center aligning the plot title

# The boxplot reveals that the credit score distributions for customers predicted to
# churn and those predicted to stay are largely overlapping, with both medians and
# interquartile ranges showing minimal differences. This suggests that credit score
# alone may not be a decisive factor in predicting customer churn. The similarity in
# score distributions across both categories indicates that customers with a wide range
# of credit scores are just as likely to remain with the bank as they are to leave.

  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("TRUE" = "Active", "FALSE" = "Not Active")) # Adjusting the Y-axis labels for IsActiveMember

# The graph demonstrates a significant difference in churn rates between active
# and inactive accounts. Notably, 19% of inactive accounts are predicted to
# churn, which is substantially higher than the mere 4.2% for active accounts.
# This pronounced disparity suggests that transactional engagement is a critical
# factor in customer retention. The data indicates that inactive accounts are
# approximately 5 times more likely to churn compared to their
# active counterparts, emphasizing the importance of regular account activity
# in customer loyalty and retention. Banks could leverage this insight to prioritize
# initiatives that encourage regular account usage, such as rewards for transactional
# activity or alerts to re-engage dormant account holders, to mitigate the higher
# churn risk associated with inactivity.

# The pie charts deliver a clear message: customers with zero balance are remarkably loyal,

# expectations. This trend presents a compelling case for the bank to closely examine and enhance 
# the value proposition for customers who actively maintain balances.

# This means it correctly identifies less than half of the actual churn cases (true positives) 
# while missing the rest (false negatives), suggesting that customers at risk of churn might not 
# be consistently flagged for intervention. On the other hand, the model excels in specificity at 95%, 
# demonstrating a high success rate in confirming customers who are likely to stay (true negatives). 
# This indicates that while the KNN model is quite reliable in affirming customer loyalty, 
# its predictive power to accurately detect churn is limited, potentially leaving a significant portion

# The comparison between Logistic Regression and KNN models for customer churn prediction shows that
# while both models have similar accuracy (0.85 for KNN and 0.83 for Logistic Regression),
# there are notable differences in sensitivity and specificity. KNN has a significantly
# higher specificity (0.95 vs. 0.7 for Logistic Regression), indicating that it is better
# at correctly identifying customers who will not churn. However, Logistic Regression outperforms
# KNN in terms of sensitivity (0.85 vs. 0.48 for KNN), meaning it is more adept at correctly
# identifying customers who will churn.

# In the context of our case study, sensitivity is crucial because failing to identify
# at-risk customers may result in a greater loss to the business than false alarms.
# High specificity is also valuable, but it is less critical than sensitivity because
# retaining satisfied customers generally requires less intervention. Given the importance of
# identifying potential churners, Logistic Regression seems to be the more appropriate model
# for our case study, as it provides a better balance between sensitivity and specificity,
# and being a more reliable predictor of actual churners.

# Future Work
# In future work, expanding the suite of machine learning models to include methods such 
# as Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines, as well as neural networks 
# and support vector machines, could offer deeper insights and potentially improved performance. 
# These models can capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions between variables 
# that simpler models might miss. Furthermore, investigating the use of feature engineering to 
# create more predictive variables could enhance model accuracy.
