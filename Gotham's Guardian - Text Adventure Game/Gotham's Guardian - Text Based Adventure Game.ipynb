    "Game Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to \"Gotham's Guardian,\" a text-based adventure game where you step into the shoes of the iconic superhero, Batman. Gotham City is under siege by its notorious villains, and it's up to you to save the day. The game unfolds over three main stages, each presenting unique challenges and decisions that shape your journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Dark Knight Duel, you'll face off against either the cunning Joker or the powerful Bane, using your skills, gadgets, and strategic thinking. The Side Mission with Catwoman takes you on a thrilling race against time to solve riddles and disable a central control system. Finally, the Gotham Challenge tests your detective skills and decision-making in critical scenarios to save the city from chaos. As Batman, your actions and decisions will determine the fate of Gotham. Each stage offers a different gameplay experience, with elements  of combat, puzzle-solving, and strategy. Be prepared to make tough choices and face the consequences of your actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is designed fondly, inspired by my love for Batman movies. 'Batman: The Dark Knight', directed by Christopher Nolan starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger as Joker is my all-time favourite movie and forms the core reason behind developing this game!\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The Batman vs Joker/Bane fight has been inspired by Pokemon Fire Red, Sapphire game on Ninteno game boy which I used to play a lot during childhood. Combat scenes have been replicated from that game (without the graphics! xD)\n",
